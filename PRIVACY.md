## Privacy Policy for Juhe Data Plugin

This plugin acts as a client to send various API requests to the Juhe Data API service.

**Data Collection:**

To function properly, this plugin requires the user to provide relevant credentials during setup in Dify. Each API has its own API key:

* `apiKey`: The API key used for authentication.

When using the plugin's tools, the following data may be processed and sent to Juhe Data:

* User query parameters (e.g., city name, currency code) used to request weather or exchange rate information.

**Data Usage:**

* The collected credential (`apiKey`) is used solely for making API requests to Juhe Data.
* User query parameters (such as city name or currency code) are transmitted directly to Juhe Data via its API.
* This plugin does not persistently store any user data or credentials beyond the necessary runtime context for executing requests. All data is transmitted via the API at request time only.

**Third-Party Services / Self-Hosting:**

* [Juhe Data Privacy Policy](https://www.juhe.cn/privacy)
